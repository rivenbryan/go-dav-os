# go-dav-os

Hobby project to dig deeper into how an OS works by writing the bare essentials of a kernel in Go. Only the kernel lives here (gccgo, x86_64 long mode); BIOS and bootloader are handled by battle-tested tools (GRUB with a Multiboot2 header). No reinvention of those pieces.

## What’s inside

- Boot: `boot/boot.s` exposes the Multiboot2 header and `_start`, sets up a 16 KB stack, enables long mode, and jumps into `kernel.Main`
  - The Multiboot2 info pointer is passed to `kernel.Main(...)` in `RDI`
  - Freestanding helpers live in `boot/` as well (minimal stubs + `memcmp` to keep the build libc-free)

- Kernel: `kernel/` in Go, freestanding build with gccgo
  - IDT + PIC remap + PIT init
  - Tick counter from the PIT and a `hlt`-based idle loop when there’s no input

- Terminal: `terminal/` writes to VGA text mode 80x25, manages cursor, scroll, and backspace

- Keyboard: `keyboard/` reads from PS/2 and maps keys with the Italian layout only (temporary)

- Tiny shell: interactive prompt + basic line editing, commands are mostly for debugging

- Memory: `mem/`
  - Multiboot2 memory map parsing (`mmap` and `mmapmax` commands)
  - A minimal 4KB page frame allocator backed by a bitmap placed inside usable memory (`pfa/alloc/free`)

- Filesystem: `fs/`
  - Minimal in-memory FS backed by allocated pages (`ls/write/cat/rm/stat`)
  
## Architecture

![DavOS Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

## Project status

- Experimental, single-core
- 64-bit only (x86_64 long mode); 32-bit is no longer supported
- Basic paging (identity map), no real storage drivers yet
- Runs in x86_64 long mode, meant for QEMU/GRUB, no UEFI
- Go runtime pared down: freestanding build (no standard library) with just the stubs the toolchain ends up expecting

## Dependencies

- Via Docker (recommended): Docker with `--platform=linux/amd64`
- Native (if you want to do it manually): cross toolchain `x86_64-elf-{binutils,gccgo}`, `grub-mkrescue`, `xorriso`, `mtools`, `qemu-system-x86_64`

## Build and run (Docker)

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t go-dav-os-toolchain .
docker run --rm --platform=linux/amd64 \
  -v "$PWD":/work -w /work go-dav-os-toolchain \
  make            # builds build/dav-go-os.iso
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/dav-go-os.iso
```

Quick targets from the Makefile
- `make docker-build-only` builds the image and the ISO
- `make run` (outside Docker) runs QEMU on an existing ISO

## Build natively

Assuming an `x86_64-elf-*` toolchain is installed

```bash
make
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/dav-go-os.iso
```

To force cross binaries: `make CROSS=x86_64-elf`

## What you’ll see on screen

- On boot the prompt `> ` shows up
- `help` lists commands, `clear` wipes the screen, `about` prints kernel info
- The kernel idles with `hlt` when nothing is happening

### Shell commands (current)

- `help`, `clear`, `about`, `echo`
- `ticks` (PIT tick counter)
- `mem <hex_addr> [len]` (hexdump)
- `mmap`, `mmapmax` (Multiboot memory map and highest usable end)
- `pfa`, `alloc`, `free <hex_addr>` (page allocator)
- `ls`, `write <name> <text...>`, `cat <name>`, `rm <name>`, `stat <name>` (filesystem)
- `version` (OS name and version)

## Other folder layout

- `iso/`: GRUB config and ISO packaging bits (grub.cfg)
- `boot/`: also contains the linker script (linker.ld) and a couple of freestanding helpers used by the build
- `build/`: build output (ISO + ELF)

## Final note

Personal, open-source, work-in-progress. I’m building pieces as I learn them—the goal is understanding, not chasing modern-OS feature lists

## Contribution
Thanks to:
@metacatdud for taking care of the entire migration from 32 to 64 bit architecture - really amazing work!
@ranjan42 for the useful documentation added and the implementation of the scheduled and the command history
@jgafnea for improving the shell and documenting the contributing section
@soorya38 for taking care of a missing part of the project - the unit tests!
